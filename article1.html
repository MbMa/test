    <h1>Abstract</h1>
    <p>
      This paper presents a brief introduction and outline of the Information
      Seeking Behaviour and Information Seeking Behaviour Models. The Paper
      specifically concentrates to reproduce the frequently cited studies viz.
      Wilson 1981 and 1996, Krikelas 1983, Dervin’s Theory of Sense Making 1983
      and 1992, Ellis 1989, Kuhlthau 1991 and 1993. Therefore, this paper may be
      very useful to the students/researchers of Information Science to get
      information on these models on Information Seeking Behaviour.
    </p>
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      The term Information Seeking Behaviour under Information Science, can
      broadly be defined as the activities performed and channels used by a
      person after identification of his/ her information needs and the
      subsequent use of the obtained information. Studies in information-seeking
      behaviour stem from concerns surrounding how people use information in
      their work environments. Information seeking behaviour arises as a
      consequence of a need perceived by the information user, who in order to
      satisfy it, makes demands upon formal or informal information sources or
      services, resulting in either success or failure (Wilson 1999:251).
    </p>
    <h1>Information Seeking Behaviour Models</h1>
    <p>
      A model may be described as a framework for thinking about a problem and
      may evolve into a statement of the relationships among theoretical
      propositions. Most models in the general field of information behaviour
      are statements, often in the form of diagrams that attempt to describe an
      information-seeking activity, the causes and consequences of that
      activity, or the relationships among stages in information-seeking
      behaviour. Kousoyiannus in Aina (2004:14) describes a model as a
      simplified representation, including the main features of the real
      situation it presents. Models therefore serve two purposes: that of
      analysing and that of predicting. Information Science has produced many
      models of Information Seeking Behaviour, in order to underpin our
      knowledge of information management, enabling us to understand the users’
      interaction with information environment. However, Wilson (1999:250) notes
      that rarely do such models advance to the stage of specifying
      relationships among theoretical propositions, rather they are at a
      pretheoretical stage, but may suggest relationships that might be fruitful
      to explore or test. Despite this criticism, several models proposed are
      well regarded and now used in further studies of user information needs. A
      few of these models are discussed in the following sections. Included are
      those developed by Wilson 1981, 1996, Krikelas 1983, Dervin’s Theory of
      Sense Making 1983, 1992, Ellis 1989, Kuhlthau 1991 and 1993. These models
      are discussed in brief as under:
    </p>
    <h2>Wilson’s Model (1981)</h2>
    <p>
      Wilson’s model has its origins in 1981 (figure 1). The main aim of this
      attempt was not so much ‘model building’, but mainly describing
      interrelationships between concepts (Wilson 1981). This model identified
      12 components involved in the information seeking process (Aina
      2004).Wilson determined that the satisfaction of an information need is
      proposed to be the driving force behind the action taken by a user. In
      order to satisfy a perceived information need, demands are made upon
      either formal or informal sources/services resulting in failure or
      success. Success leads to the utilization of the information, which
      results in fully or partially fulfilling the perceived need. Should this
      not be the case, the search process is repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilson gave another model in year 1981 which may be identified as Wilson’s
      second model of 1981 (figure 2). This diagram models the idea of the
      personal, social role, and environmental context that may give rise to a
      need for information. Of particular significance of this model was the
      division of the 'needs' that give rise to information seeking behaviour
      into physiological, affective and cognitive needs and also presence of
      barriers which must be overcome before information seeking takes place.
      This model focuses more on information needs of the users and the types of
      barriers that users may face in seeking information but does not detail in
      any specific way how users look for information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilson later (1999) described this 1981 model as a 'macro model or a model
      of the gross information–seeking behaviour’, suggesting that it implies
      hypotheses about information context without making them explicit, and
      that it does not indicate the processes whereby a person is affected by
      context, nor how context then affects his or her perception of barriers to
      information seeking.
    </p>
    <h2>Krikelas Model</h2>
    <p>
      Krikelas (1983) suggests that a user perceives a need within the context
      of his/her environment. The individual recognizes an inadequacy in his/her
      knowledge which requires resolution in order to deal with a problem, thus
      leading the user on a search for information through various information
      sources. These could be human sources, information systems or any other
      information resources. The process may result in either success or
      failure; in the latter’s case the process can be repeated (Hayden n.d.).
      According to Krikelas (1983) information can be seen as any stimulus that
      reduces uncertainty. An information need is defined as the recognition of
      the existence of this uncertainty in the personal or work-related life of
      the individual.
    </p>
    <p>
      Krikelas further divides information seeking behaviour. However, according
      to Krikelas (1983), unconscious needs do not necessarily lead to eventual
      action.
    </p>
    <h2>Dervin’s Therory of Sense-Making (1983; 1992)</h2>
    <p>
      This theory has been developed over a number of years and is one of the
      most widely studied and used theories in current information science
      research. Dervin’s (1983; 1992) sense-making theory is more than simply a
      model of information seeking behaviour. Although it was originally
      designed for studying information needs, seeking, and use from a
      communication perspective, it has evolved into “a generalized
      communication-based methodology seen as useful for study of human
      sense-making (and sense-unmaking) in any context” (Dervin, 1999). the
      sense-making theory consists of four major elements: Situation – a
      particular period in space and time that provides context for the
      information problem. Outcome – The end result of the sense-making
      activity. Gap – the barriers (e.g., uncertainty) between the situation and
      desired outcome. Bridge – the means by which the gap between the situation
      and outcome is crossed (Dervin, 1983). Dervin presented these elements in
      terms of a Triangle (Figure 3): situation, gap/bridge, and outcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, it appears simpler to understand this concept using a bridge
      metaphor of Dervin (figure 4) which is the extended and elaborated form of
      Dervin’s sense making framework (1983).
    </p>
    <p>
      This model highlights the questions about nature of the situation and also
      clearly depicts the challenges that an information seeker faces in
      reaching the desired outcome by utilizing the information to bridge up the
      gap.
    </p>
    <h2>Ellis Model (1989)</h2>
    <p>
      Ellis provided features of information seeking behaviours instead of
      stages. By mentioning the ‘staging’ label, he implies that the behaviours
      do not necessarily occur in sequence; instead, the unique circumstances of
      the information seeking activities of the information seeker at that
      specific point in time influence the pattern followed (Ellis 1989). These
      features are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Starting: this implies the initiation of information</li>
      <li>
        Chaining: Using the references as links between different materials to
        identify the suitable sources of information.
      </li>
      <li>Browsing: semi-directed or semi-structured searching</li>
      <li>
        Differentiating: Distinguishing the information sources in terms of its
        relevance
      </li>
      <li>
        Monitoring: Using different sources to keep up-to-date or current
        awareness searching
      </li>
      <li>
        Extracting: selectively identifying and taking the relevant material in
        an information source
      </li>
      <li>Verifying: Scrutinizing the accuracy of the obtained information</li>
      <li>Ending: Finalizing by tying up loose ends through a final search.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Although Ellis never provided any sequence in which these stages occur,
      yet Wilson provides a diagrammatic stage model of Ellis’ features (figure
      5)
    </p>
    <h2>Kuhlthau (1991, 1993)</h2>
    <p>
      Kuhlthau’s work complements that of Ellis by attaching to stages of
      information Search Process the In contrast with Ellis, Kuhlthau ascribes
      definite stages to the ‘information seeking process’ the associated
      feelings, thoughts and actions. She identified six stages, i.e.
      Initiation, Selection, Exploration, Formulation, Collection, and Search
      closure/Presentation, that are followed in sequence (Kuhlthau,1991).
      Rather than just mechanically searching for information, this model
      incorporates the affective (feelings), the cognitive (thoughts) and the
      physical (actions and strategies) (Hayden n.d.).
    </p>
    <p>
      Kuhlthau’s model postulates that the search process is an active process,
      engaging the cognitive processes of the information seeker. Triggered by
      feelings of uncertainty, the need for an information search manifests
      itself. The feelings of uncertainty probably increase during the
      exploration stage, when general, as opposed to specific, information on a
      topic is gathered.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, Kuhlthau’s empirical studies reveal that this is likely to
      decrease during the next stage, i.e. the formulation stage, when a focused
      perspective on the topic, based on the information retrieved, is
      formulated (Hayden n.d.; Kuhlthau 1996). Wilson (1999) describes this
      information seeking process as ‘a process of gradual refinement of the
      problem area, with information searching of one kind or another going on
      while refinement takes place’. Hayden (n.d.), however, points out that
      this model does not cater for the manipulation of information, i.e the
      analysis, digestion,organisation, synthesis and evaluation of the
      retrieved information.
    </p>
    <h2>Wilson’s Model (1996)</h2>
    <p>
      Wilson’s Model of 1996 is a substantially revised form of his model given
      in 1981. The new model concentrates on describing general information
      behaviour, as opposed to only information seeking behaviour (Wilson 1997).
    </p>
    <p>
      Using specific theories, Wilson explains how needs prompt people’s
      information seeking behaviour, source preference, and why some pursue a
      goal more successfully than others.
    </p>
    <p>
      This model also seeks to explain the role played by various activating
      mechanisms or motivators influencing the "what", "how" and extent of a
      search. He identifies variables such as psychological, demographic, and
      social/environmental factors, and the characteristics of information
      sources in determining information seeking behaviour that affect
      motivation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The model also expanded on different types of information seeking
      behaviour, including "passive" methods of seeking information, i.e.
      "passive search", where unintentional searching leads to the acquisition
      of relevant information, and "passive attention"" where no intentional
      information seeking takes place, but information is still unconsciously
      acquired through listening to the radio or watching television (Mckenzie
      2002; Mostert 2004).
    </p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      It can easily be perceived that all these models are complementary to each
      other and focus to describe the Information Seeking process in a broad
      approach. As such, most general Information seeking behaviour models seem
      to take cognizance of the fact that a user in need of information may use
      a variety of information sources, services, systems, or even contact
      individuals in an effort to solve a problem. However, reference is seldom
      made to the use of a third person, such as a librarian, secretary or
      personal assistant for problem solving (see Mostert and Ocholla, 2005).
      This oversight indicates a disregard for variations and context in
      information seeking.
